NAME
    Barcode::DataMatrix - Generate data for Data Matrix barcodes

SYNOPSIS
        use Barcode::DataMatrix;
        my $data = Barcode::DataMatrix->new->barcode('MONKEY');
        for my $row (@$data) {
            print for map { $_ ? "#" : ' ' } @$row;
            print "\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This class is used to generate data for Data Matrix barcodes. It is
    primarily useful as a data source for barcode modules that do rendering,
    such as HTML::Barcode::DataMatrix. You can easily make a version that
    renders an image, PDF, or anything else.

METHODS
  new (%attributes)
    Instantiate a new Barcode::DataMatrix object. The `%attributes' hash can
    take any of the other attributes listed below.

  barcode ($text)
    Generate barcode data representing the `$text' string. This returns an
    array ref of rows in the data matrix, each containing array refs of
    cells within that row. The cells are true and false values that
    represent filled or empty squares.

    This can throw an exception if it's unable to generate the barcode data.

ATTRIBUTES
  encoding_mode
    The encoding mode for the data matrix. Can be one of: `AUTO' (default),
    `ASCII', `C40', `TEXT', `BASE256', or `NONE'.

  process_tilde
    Set to true to indicate the tilde character "~" is being used to
    recognize special characters. See this page for more information:
